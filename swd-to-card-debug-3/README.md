# OreSat Card Debug Board

This folder contains the CAD for the "Card Debug Board" used to program all of OreSat's cards and solar modules.

Version 1 was our original board.

Version 2 integrates an STLink v3mini onboard.

Version 3 integrates an RP2040 with Raspberry Pi Debug Probe firmware to talk to the card's microcontroller and present a virtual UART (serial port).
